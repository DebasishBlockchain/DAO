# Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) Smart Contract

## Overview

This repository contains a simplified implementation of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) smart contract written in Solidity, the programming language for Ethereum smart contracts. The DAO allows members to create and vote on proposals, with voting power determined by the number of shares they hold.

## Smart Contract Features

- **Membership**: Add members to the DAO with a specified number of shares, which represent their voting power.

- **Proposal Creation**: Create proposals with descriptions for members to vote on.

- **Voting**: Members can vote "yes" or "no" on proposals.

- **Proposal Execution**: Proposals can be executed if they receive more "yes" votes than "no" votes.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local environment.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DebasishBlockchain/dao-smart-contract.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies, such as the Solidity compiler and development tools.

3. Compile the smart contract using your preferred Solidity development environment.

4. Deploy the smart contract on an Ethereum development network or testnet.

5. Interact with the smart contract to add members, create proposals, and vote on proposals.

## Smart Contract Functions

- `addMember(address member, uint256 _shares)`: Add a member to the DAO with a specified number of shares.

- `createProposal(string memory description)`: Create a new proposal with a description.

- `vote(uint256 proposalId, bool approve)`: Vote "yes" or "no" on a proposal.

- `executeProposal(uint256 proposalId)`: Execute a proposal if it receives enough "yes" votes.

## Sample Usage

1. Deploy the DAO smart contract on an Ethereum testnet.

2. Add members to the DAO and assign them shares.

3. Create proposals with descriptions.

4. Members can vote on the proposals.

5. Execute proposals that receive sufficient "yes" votes.
